# Genshin Impact Team Maker
Build your Genshin Impact team and export it as a wallpaper or URL! This project was directly inspired by @MedLamrouah's Z (Dragonball FighterZ team builder) and uses some of his code as a base.

I originally decided to make this app to better myself as a software developer and also allow myself and others a way to cement their identity with their favorite teams and characters from Genshin. I hope you enjoy this utility as much as I did making it! I'll be sure to update this app with new characters' assets as soon as they're officially announced from Mihoyo, for as long as the game keeps being updated.
